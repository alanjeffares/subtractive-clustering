# Subtractive Clustering
</div>

My implementation of the subtractive clustering algorithm as described in Sheng-Wu Xiong, Xiao-Xiao Niu and Hong-Bing Liu, (2005). I implement the algorithm and test it on synthetic data where the underlying distribution is a set of three Gaussian clusters in 3-dimensional space.

* `evaluation.py` - Evaluation of algorithm on synthetic `data.csv`.

## Usage
Navigate to the repository folder and simply run `python evaluation.py` on the command line.
